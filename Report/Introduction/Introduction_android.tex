\section{Introduction to Android}
\index{Android}
\subsection{History of Android}
\index{Android!History}
Historically, developers, generally coding in low-level C or C++, have needed to
understand the specific hardware they were coding for, generally a single device
or possibly a range of devices from a single manufacturer. As hardware technology
and mobile Internet access has advanced, this closed approach has become
outmoded.
\\\\
In more recent years, the biggest advance in mobile phone development was the
introduction of Java hosted MIDlets. MIDlets are executed on a Java virtual
machine, a process that abstracts the underlying hardware and lets developers
create applications that run on the wide variety of devices that supports the
Java run time. Unfortunately, this convenience comes at the price of restricted
access to the device hardware.
\\\\
Android sits alongside a new wave of mobile operating systems designed for
increasingly powerful mobile hardware. Windows Mobile, the Apple iPhone, and the
Palm Pre now provide a richer, simplified development environment for mobile
applications. However, unlike Android, they're built on proprietary operating
systems that in some cases prioritize native applications over those created by
third parties, restrict communication among applications and native phone data,
and restrict or control the distribution of third-party apps to their platforms.

\subsection{Why Android?}
\index{Android!Why Android?}
Android has the potential for removing the barriers to success in the development
and sale of a new generation of mobile phone application software. Just as the
the standardized PC and Macintosh platforms created markets for desktop and
server software.

Here are several Android platform development advantages you can get if you
choose Android:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Affordability and customization.} The main Android platform
development advantage of the Google Android OS it is open source, meaning that
its source code is freely available to developers. And because the code is free,
there are no licensing fees to deal with and Android app developers have more
leeway in terms of developing apps.

\item \textbf{A low barrier to entry in the mobile application market.} Because
the technology is open sourced, Google Android apps are less expensive to produce
compared to other mobile operating systems like the IPhone OS and Windows Mobile.
Quite often the primary costs for building apps for Android include development
and testing expertise of developers, cost of test devices and royalty fees in
case you want to distribute your app to third-party app stores like the Android
Market.
\end{itemize}
