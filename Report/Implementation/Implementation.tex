\section{Data model}
Using the client server application, we deployed a EJB on the glassfish Java
application server to manage all the data model using JPA persistence. For that
perpuse we created two main packages under org.hyperpath.persistence:
\begin{description}
  \item[jpa: ] this package contains all the jpa controller nedded to manage the
  data model
  \item[entities: ] this package holds the entities class mapping the data model
\end{description}
